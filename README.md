# Qt Shape Drawing Demo

This is a simple educational Qt application demonstrating basic graphics and mouse event handling.

## Features

- A menu to select shape types: Circle, Square, Triangle, or Random.
- In Random mode:
  - While dragging with the left mouse button, new shapes are added at the cursor position (up to 20).
  - Shapes follow each other in a "snake-like" motion â€” each shape moves to the previous one's position.
